  <h1>Charles Hardt</h1>
  <p><em>Violinist &amp; Web Developer</em></p>
  <p>I am a violinist in the Miami area. I have
    freelanced in South Florida since 1997, playing regularly with
    the <a href="https://artisnaples.org/naples-philharmonic/">Naples Philharmonic</a>, the <a href="https://fgo.org/">Florida Grand Opera</a>, the <a href="https://www.palmbeachsymphony.org/">Palm Beach Symphony</a>, the <a href="https://www.miamicityballet.org/">Miami City Ballet</a>, Boca Pops Orchestra, and many other orchestras. I have
    performed on stage with Placido Domingo, Renee Fleming, Kathleen Battle, Charles Castleman, Itzhak Perlman, Emanuel Ax, and many other of the greatest artists of our day.
    I am also a full-stack web developer and a Ving Tsun kung fu practitioner in the Moy Yat lineage. My other interests and adventures
    include sailing, <a href="https://www.librarything.com/catalog/charleshardt/yourlibrary">book collecting</a>, and other things.</p>

  <h3>Teachers</h3>
  <h4>Music</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>From <em>2015&ndash;2020,</em> I studied with the legendary virtuoso <strong><a href="http://www.charlescastleman.com/">Charles Castleman</a></strong>, who was a student of Emanuel Ondricek and Ivan Galamian. Ondricek was a student of Otakar
      Sevcik. Galamian was a student of Lucien Capet and Konstantin Mostras, who was a student of Leopold Auer. Charlie taught me about being a virtuoso violinist in the grand tradition.</li>
    <li>From <em>2014&ndash;2018</em>, I learned score study from <a href="http://www.sleepermusic.com/"><strong>Thom Sleeper</strong></a>. I was Thom&rsquo;s concertmaster for his last five years at the university. Thom taught me about large-scale structure, about the power of believing in people, and that it&rsquo;s all about the music, not yourself.</li>
    <li>From <em>1994&ndash;2000,</em> and again from <em>2014&ndash;2015,</em> I studied with <strong><a href="https://artisnaples.org/naples-philharmonic/musicians/glenn-basham">Glenn Basham</a></strong>, concertmaster of the Naples Philharmonic.
      He was a student of Yuval Yaron and Vartan Manoogian. Yaron was a student of Joseph Gingold and Jascha Heifetz. Manoogian was a student of Galamian. Glenn mentored me for many years and taught me that there are no excuses. He gave me a modern technique, taught me how to play in an orchestra, gave me many opportunities, and shielded me from many pitfalls.</li>
    <li>In the <em>summer of 1997,</em> I studied with the legendary soloist <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruggiero_Ricci">Ruggiero Ricci</a></strong>, who was a student of Louis Persinger. Ricci taught me a lot about left-hand technique.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Ving Tsun</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <img src="smith-hardt-166x249.jpg" alt="Lineage Photo - Robert Smith taught Charles Hardt" style="float:right">
      <img src="moy-smith-166x249.jpg" alt="Lineage Photo - Moy Yat taught Robert Smith" style="float:right">
      <img src="yip-moy-166x249.jpg" alt="Lineage Photo - Yip Man taught Moy Yat" style="float:right">
      On May 19, 2016, <a href="https://zenwingchun.org/lineage/moy-yee-hop/">Julian Cordero aka Moy Yee Hop</a> opened my fists. In 10 private lessons, he and his student Daniel taught me Siu Nim Tau (<span class="hanzi">小念頭</span>), the
      center punch (<span class="hanzi">日字中捶</span>), palm strike (<span class="hanzi">點掌</span>), throat chop (<span class="hanzi">拂手</span>), the Paak Sau drill (<span class="hanzi">拍手</span>), and the wall bag (<span class="hanzi">沙包</span>).
      Julian Sifu taught me to play Siu Nim Tau as slowly as the minute hand of a clock, and that the more relaxed Taan Sau is,
      the more kung fu enters your hands. In my last lesson, he taught me Golden Rooster Stands on One Leg (<span class="hanzi">金雞独立</span>) and said that the next time he saw me, he should be able to sit on my raised knee.</li>
    <li>On May 9, 2017, with Sifu Julian's permission, I became a student of his kung fu brother <a href="http://www.miamiwingchun.com/sifu-smith.html">Sifu Robert Smith</a>. Sifu Robert's school was 10 minutes away from University of Miami
      and Sifu Julian's was a 2 hour's drive, so changing schools made it possible to continue training while I was gaining a doctorate at the University of Miami. Both Julian Sifu and Sifu Robert were high-level early disciples of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moy_Yat">Moy Yat</a>, one of the top students of the legendary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ip_Man">Yip Man</a>.
    </li>
    <li>In October 2019, I became an indoor disciple of Sifu Robert. In our school, we do not perform the baai si (<span class="hanzi">拜師</span>) ceremony, serve Sifu tea, or do the three kneels and nine kowtows. A lineage photo was taken and I gave
      Sifu a red envelope. </li>
    <li>The sihings I have learned most from are Mark Chen, Nigel Jordan, Yoandry Lopez, Ben Ivey, Alejandro Gonzalez, and Lester Rojas. Jan Fine taught me Chum Kiu (<span class="hanzi">尋橋</span>). Daniel Zapata taught me Biu Ji (<span
        class="hanzi">鏢指</span>). Whenever I learned a new section of the Muk Yan
      Jong
      (<span class="hanzi">木人樁</span>), I played it for Nigel or Yoandry and they corrected me. Sifu taught me the first part of the Gwan (<span class="hanzi">六點半棍</span>). I learned a lot from Alejandro and Lester during our training sessions on the
      back patio. Throughout
      the summer of 2019, we trained for 4 hours at a
      time, even on the hottest days of the year.</li>
